I've managed dozens of people in large scale art installations, raised millions in institutional capital for my own AI startup, helped large organizations understand and improve their culture through day-long workshops and year-long projects. But no matter what I'm doing, whether it's creating a coworking space or helping warring cafes become kinder to each, I've always called myself a designer. I do this not because of any methodology I apply, but because I always move forward with empathy and thoughtfulness as my main modes of operation.
